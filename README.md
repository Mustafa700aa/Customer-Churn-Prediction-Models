---> Customer Churn Prediction Models

This repository contains machine learning models and training scripts for predicting customer churn using three different algorithms:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**

---> Contents
- `KNN.py`: Script for training and evaluating the KNN model.
- `Random_forest .py`: Script for training and evaluating the Random Forest model.
- `gradient_boosting_classification.py`: Script for training and evaluating the Gradient Boosting model.
- `*.pkl`: Pretrained models and scalers for each algorithm.
- `feature_columns.pkl`: Pickled list of selected features used during training.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

---> Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
